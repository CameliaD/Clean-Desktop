# CleanDesktop
Automate decluttering your desktop with a user friendly PowerShell script with GUI.

Sick of cluttered desktops? With just one click, you can clean your cluttered desktop. Check out the video below to see how you can automate the desktop cleaning routine and have a productive day.

## Is this tool for you?

This desktop cleaner is for you if:

- Your desktop keeps getting cluttered by files.
- You always postpone cleaning your desktop.
- Keeping your desktop organized is too time-consuming for you.

## How it works

The CleanDesktop script works by moving files from the desktop into specific folders based on their file extension. For example, it will move image files into an "Images" folder, documents into a "Documents" folder, and so on. You can customize the script to match your preferences by specifying which file types should be moved and where they should be moved to.
